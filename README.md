Current Emerging Trends in IT
### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
> The purpose of this project is to create a pirate intelligent agent using proper technique of AI algorthim; so the AI can find the treasure before human player
> I were given a skeletion of pirate intelligent agent code, but I was able to create a deep Q learning implementation based on MDP to train the AI model from neural network
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
> Computer Scientist is entirely different from coder or programmer since they are involving in creating, researching, developing new implementation for IT fields such as cyber security, machine learning, artificial intelligence ... in order to catch up with the current trends of technology
### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
> As a computer scientist, extensively time and effort must be spent researching the purpose and the outcome is a must before approaching the problem directly
### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? 
> My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization would be transparancy, accountability as well as protecting user's privacy since they are all important factors to the development of technology
